In the cell below, define a function called sign which takes a numerical argument and returns -1 if it's negative, 1 if it's positive, and 0 if it's 0

In the main lesson we talked about deciding whether we're prepared for the weather. I said that I'm safe from today's weather if...

I have an umbrella...
or if the rain isn't too heavy and I have a hood...
otherwise, I'm still fine unless it's raining and it's a workday
The function below uses our first attempt at turning this logic into a Python expression. I claimed that there was a bug in that code. Can you find it?

To prove that prepared_for_weather is buggy, come up with a set of inputs where either:

the function returns False (but should have returned True), or
the function returned True (but should have returned False).
To get credit for completing this question, your code should return a Correct result.

The function is_negative below is implemented correctly - it returns True if the given number is negative and False otherwise.

However, it's more verbose than it needs to be. We can actually reduce the number of lines of code in this function by 75% while keeping the same behaviour.

See if you can come up with an equivalent body that uses just one line of code, and put it in the function concise_is_negative. (HINT: you don't even need Python's ternary syntax)

The boolean variables ketchup, mustard and onion represent whether a customer wants a particular topping on their hot dog. We want to implement a number of boolean functions that correspond to some yes-or-no questions about the customer's order. For example:

We‚Äôve seen that calling bool() on an integer returns False if it‚Äôs equal to 0 and True otherwise. What happens if we call int() on a bool? Try it out in the notebook cell below.

Can you take advantage of this to write a succinct function that corresponds to the English sentence "does the customer want exactly one topping?"?

7. üå∂Ô∏è (Optional)

In this problem we'll be working with a simplified version of blackjack (aka twenty-one). In this version there is one player (who you'll control) and a dealer. Play proceeds as follows:

The player is dealt two face-up cards. The dealer is dealt one face-up card.
The player may ask to be dealt another card ('hit') as many times as they wish. If the sum of their cards exceeds 21, they lose the round immediately.
The dealer then deals additional cards to himself until either:
the sum of the dealer's cards exceeds 21, in which case the player wins the round
the sum of the dealer's cards is greater than or equal to 17. If the player's total is greater than the dealer's, the player wins. Otherwise, the dealer wins (even in case of a tie).
When calculating the sum of cards, Jack, Queen, and King count for 10. Aces can count as 1 or 11 (when referring to a player's "total" above, we mean the largest total that can be made without exceeding 21. So e.g. A+8 = 19, A+8+8 = 17)

For this problem, you'll write a function representing the player's decision-making strategy in this game. We've provided a very unintelligent implementation below:
"""


def should_hit(dealer_total, player_total, player_low_aces, player_high_aces):
    """Return True if the player should hit (request another card) given the current game
    state, or False if the player should stay.
    When calculating a hand's total value, we count aces as "high" (with value 11) if doing so
    doesn't bring the total above 21, otherwise we count them as low (with value 1).
    For example, if the player's hand is {A, A, A, 7}, we will count it as 11 + 1 + 1 + 7,
    and therefore set player_total=20, player_low_aces=2, player_high_aces=1.

    return (True if player_total < 17 else False)
